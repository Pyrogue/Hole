check bonding nubers

for monday:
	make functions return all UPPECASE or all lowercase for easy checking (pair with UC(), LC() respectively)

for thursday:
	outout unmodified cell as 0
	remove #5... zeolite
	are there any Si-Si or C-C bonds? faster bonding algoyrythm...
	Volume Relaxation
	input defaults. on file



FOR Friday(may3):
X	make sure that scaled models movement restrictions are removed.
X	replace tabs with spaces.
	figure out hole and bond ratios... gathering and analyzing data
	make  hole models from exact center
	make filename obj and impliment
	maybe remake atom array to pointers... dynamic allocation and better bonding

FOR THURSDAY:
	passivation working at all costs


FOR TUESDAY:
	make slides of progress, etc.
	get a working simulation and output results.


write:
	bonding numbers and lengths (check jobs dir)
	sim::Mass() - a rather poor start so far
	impliment multipliers! not used right now! will come back to bite me!
reWrite:
	sim::ReadData()	- need better way to read int 
dynamic allocation
test limits of memory on lion xf

XXX there will be problems with removing atoms... (pointers will no longer work!)
	make sure associate unassocates first.
	make sure removing atoms accounts for pointers!
	dynamic memory? aat least replace atom[][] with *atom[][]
		need to be able to do operations on all atoms efficiently
		arrays are easy.

rewrite bond lengths... not SUPER important... yet.


sorted lists of atoms. faster searching

recursive hole-making algorythm... would not work across boundaries... or for free (unbound atoms)
but would be extremely efficient!


1. make porous models using model which is 4x2x2 of the unit cell ( ~ 12.4 A x 10.6 A x 10.1 A  with 64 si and 64 c ).
2. Make various crystalline supercells 3x2x2 , 4x2x2, 5x3x3, 6x4x4, 7x4x4, 8x4x4
3. repeat 1 with pores on edge putting center of pore at edge.si and 64 c
	HUH? what is edge Si?
4. coding project start with 8x4x4 model input final density and average pore size.
5. get onto lion xf and run code there and put models in group file



WOW
	I misplaced a negative in the coordinate file... that was a nightmare.

1)	is treated as a comment line (you should write down the 'name' of the system). 
2)	line provides a universal scaling factor ('lattice constant'), which is used to 
	scale all lattice vectors and all atomic coordinates. (If this value is negative
	it is interpreted as the total volume of the cell). 
3,4,5) the three lattice vectors defining the unit cell of the system are given 
	(first line corresponding to the first lattice vector, second to the second, and third to the third). 
6)	supplies the number of atoms per atomic species (one number for each atomic species). 
	The ordering must be consistent with the POTCAR and the INCAR file. 
7)	switches to 'Selective dynamics' (only the first character is relevant and must be 'S' or 's'). 
	This mode allows to provide extra flags for each atom signaling whether the respective coordinate(s) of this atom will be allowed to change during the ionic relaxation. This setting is useful if only certain 'shells' around a defect or 'layers' near a surface should relax. Mind: The 'Selective dynamics' input tag is optional: The seventh line supplies the switch between cartesian and direct lattice if the 'Selective dynamics' tag is omitted.

POSCAR format (This is strait to the point)

thank you so much!
