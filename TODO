ATOM eye (MIT)

check bonding nubers

FOR THURSDAY:
	passivation working at all costs


FOR TUESDAY:
	make slides of progress, etc.
	get a working simulation and output results.


write:
	sim::passivate
	sim::Mass() - a rather poor start so far
	impliment multipliers! not used right now! will come back to bite me!
reWrite:
	sim::ReadData()	- need better way to read int 
dynamic allocation
test limits of memory on lion xf

XXX there will be problems with removing atoms... (pointers will no longer work!)
	make sure associate unassocates first.
	make sure removing atoms accounts for pointers!
	dynamic memory? aat least replace atom[][] with *atom[][]
		need to be able to do operations on all atoms efficiently
		arrays are easy.

rewrite bond lengths... not SUPER important... yet.


sorted lists of atoms. faster searching

recursive hole-making algorythm... would not work across boundaries... or for free (unbound atoms)
but would be extremely efficient!


1. make porous models using model which is 4x2x2 of the unit cell ( ~ 12.4 A x 10.6 A x 10.1 A  with 64 si and 64 c ).
2. Make various crystalline supercells 3x2x2 , 4x2x2, 5x3x3, 6x4x4, 7x4x4, 8x4x4
3. repeat 1 with pores on edge putting center of pore at edge.si and 64 c
	HUH? what is edge Si?
4. coding project start with 8x4x4 model input final density and average pore size.
5. get onto lion xf and run code there and put models in group file



WOW
	I misplaced a negative in the coordinate file... that was a nightmare.
