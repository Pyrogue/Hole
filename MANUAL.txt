pore - Passivating Objective Radial Eliminator

This code creates a nanometer hole or pore in a periodic atomic model.

IV. INPUT PARAMETERS

I. Introduction: The goal of this code is to create atomic models for systems that include pores or holes.  A simple example would be a hydrogenated silicon vacancy inside bulk crystalline silicon. The vacancy can be hydrogenated or not and is an example of a small pore inside a bulk material. New materials grown by various methods include numerous pores distrubuted throughout the structure.  This code allows us to model such complex situations starting from a bulk periodic atomic model.

II. Build:  The code is written in c++ and can be built using the Makefile included in the distribution.

make [options]
    Options:
        a,all       Compile the project
        r,remake    Recompile from scratch
        c,clean     Remove generated files (binary and object files)
File Syntax

The executable is written into the subdirectory as ./bin/pore

III.  Run Files:  

To run the code you simple need the executable and the input file.

> pore input

a. Input files

The input file can have any name.


Notes:

Neither the sections or settings are case-sensitive.
The file can be delimited by either spaces or tabs
POSCAR format (format of .vasp files used througout)
Comments

@ act as comments, and pore will ignore anything after that character.

Settings by Section - (Docopt syntax)

Input

filename <filename> [<X Y Z>]   
filename <file.tsv>
Options:
    <filename>  file in POSCAR format (.vasp)

    <X Y Z>     Scale file amount in direction [default: 1  1   1]
note:
    multiple "filename" lines may be included!

Scaling

Scale <X Y Z>
Scale <file.tsv>
Options:
    <file.tsv>  File containing scales [Format for each line: (<file.tsv> | <X Y Z>)]

note:
    multiple "scale" lines may be included!

        N   number of the model
    Default: "N"
    Note: case-insensitive
delimeter (space | tab | <string>)
extension <extension>
    Options:
        <extension> Extension appended to the file with a leading '.'
    Note:   can use "extension" to place a suffix on filenames
Data

tag [options] %<elementSymbol>% #<elementSymbol>#
    Options:
        c,C Center of pores
        D   Density of the model in g/cm^3

        I   Input filename
        O   Output filename
        P   Passivation number (Delta#H)
        p   path to output file
        R   Radius caluclated from average distance to passivation (Angstroms)
        r   radius used for making pores (Angstroms)
        S   The Full scale of the model (filescale*scale)
        %<elementSymbol>%   The percent of the element in model by number
        #<elementSymbol>#   The number of the element in model
    Note: these weill be written as headers to the datafile in the order selected
    Example: tag I%Si%RO
filename <file.tsv>
