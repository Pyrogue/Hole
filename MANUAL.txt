===========================================

I. Introduction: The goal of this code is to create atomic models for systems that include pores or holes.  A simple example would be a hydrogenated vacancy inside bulk crystalline silicon.  In this example, one silicon atom is removed from a bulk model and four hydrogens passivate the silicon dangling bonds. The vacancy is an example of a small pore inside a bulk material. New materials grown by various methods include numerous nano-pores distrubuted throughout the structure.  This code allows us to model such complex situations starting from a bulk periodic atomic model.


II.  Run Files:  

A. Executable

To run the code, you need the executable, the input file and the initial periodic atomic model.   The executable "pore" is run with a script file included in the code distribution.  The script makes the executable if needed & then runs it.  The script may be edited to suite your needs.  Commonly, you may wish to rename in the file which includes the input parameters.  


B. Input files

Two input files are needed to run the pore executable successfully (i) a periodic atomic model and (ii) a parameter input control file.

i. periodic atomic model

An initial periodic atomic model is required to successfully run the pore executable.  The format for the atomic model follows the VASP POSCAR Direct coordinates format.  See VASP Manual for more details.  After executing the pore code a final periodic model will be created with the same lattice vectors but a new list of atoms due to the construction of pores within the initial structure.

ii. parameter input control file

The input file with the control parameters can have any name.  The file includes all the parameters which controls the execution fo the code and the generation of the ouput.

C. Output Files

The code generates two output files.  One is an atomic model or set of atomic models in the VASP format. These files are named according to a convention as determined by the input control.file.  The code can also generate a tab seperated data file with details regarding the properties of the pore model(s) generated.


IV. Input Parameters

There are numerous input parameters to control the execution of the pore code.  The parameters are organized by section.  However, the parameters are read by the code using the free format style and can be listed in any order.  Below we discuss each section of parameters in detail. None of the parameters are case-sensitive.  Free format is used with one parameter per line. For each line, one must list the parameter first, one or more spaces or tabs, and then the value.  Most parameters have default values and so do not need to be included explicitely.   


@ act as comments, and the pore executable will ignore anything after that character.

@Input file parameter

1. in_file: This is the parameter for the name of the initial atomic periodic model. 

>in_file <filename> [<NX NY NZ>]

<filename> can be any set of characters with no spaces between characters.  (Default value: None)
<filename> must refer to a file that is in the POSCAR Direct coordinate format.  

NX, NY and NZ = integers greater than or equal to 1.  (Default value: 1 1 1)

The code uses the NX, NY and NZ integers to create a supercell of the initial input coodinate file.  The final result is a bulk input model with lattice constant lengths multiplied (by the factors NX,NY and NZ ) and with the atomic coodinates repeated as well.

Examples:

>in_file bulkSilicon.vasp
>in_file bulkSilicon.vasp 1 1 1

The above two examples produce the same result.

>in_file bulkSilicon.vasp 1 1     4
>in_file model_directory/bulkSiC 2 4 5

The above two lines will create supercells of the initial models.  While the  POSCAR Direct format is required, the file name does not need to include the ending .vasp.  The last one above looks in a subdirectory for the input file.

Multiple Input Files: To create pore models for several initial coordinate files, write the various "filename" values on seperate lines. For instance, the examples above could be run at the same time from a single file, if desired.


@Pore Generation Parameters

2. center:  This parameter determines where the center(s) of the pore(s) will be located inside the model.

option 1:

>center <x> <y> <z>

<x> <y> <z> = numerical value between 0 and 1 seperated by a space. ( Default value: 0.0 0.0 0.0)

Option 2:

>random <number>

<number> = Number of pores to attempt to create (Default value: 1)

The <x> <y> and <z> position of the center is determined by a random number generator.

Option 3:

>distribute <number>

The centers are distributed evenly through out the initial unit cell.

Option 4:

>random_no_overlap <number>
    
The centers are distributed randomly through out the unit cell with a test to ensure no overlapp between roughly sphrical pores.

These options can be combined by listing them in the input file on seperate lines.  The code will notify you if your pores overlapp, which is often unphysical.

Examples:

>center 0.3 0.4 0.55
>distribute 4
>random 4
>random_no_overlap 3

Including all four lines in one input file would result in each function being called (which may lead to problems)

3. radius: This parameter determines the length of the radius for the sphere of atoms to be removed. 

Option 1:

>radius <angstroms>

<angstroms> = length of radius in units of Angstroms (Default value: None )

Option 2:

>radius from <begin> to <end> by <step>

Creates a series of a single pore models with the pores having varying radii.

<begin> = initial radius value 
<end> = final radius value
<step> = step size for radius attempted between initial and final radii.

The code checks the final model for each radii and only produces output for unique models.

4. passivation: This parameter allows one to choose an element other than hydrogen to passivate dangling bonds at the surface of pores.

>passivation <elementSymbol>

<elementSymbol> = one or two character names from the periodic table. ( Default value: H )

Examples:

>passivation H
>passivation F
>passivation He

The first is the same as the default value of hydrogen, the second line invokes florine and the third line inserts helium (although being a noble gas this may not be sensible).

The bond length between the passivator and the pore surface atom is determined by the effective covalent radii of the two elements.

@Output

5. out_file:  This parameter designates the name of the output coordinate file.

>out_file <filename>

<filename> = any set of characters with no spaces.  (Default value: integer N = number for model generated)

The coordinate name output file will have .vasp appended to it.

Examples:

Ex 1:

> out_file 

This results in a coordinate file named: 1.vasp

Ex 2:

>out_file ../3C

This results in a coordinate file named: 3C.vasp placed in the directory above the run directory.

6. extension:  This parameter allows the user to change the out.file extension from .vasp to any character string.

>extension <extension>

<extension> = extension appended to the file with a leading '.'
    

@Data

7. data_file:  This parameter determines the name of the name of the data file generated by the executable.

data.file <filename>

<filename> = any set of characters without spaces (Default value: N.data where)

The default integer N is the integer associated with the number of


8. tag: This parameter controls the data written in to the data.file.


tag [options] %<elementSymbol>% #<elementSymbol>#
    Options:
        D   Density of the model in g/cm^3
        E   Extension of the file
        I   Input filename
        O   Output filename
        P   Passivation number (Delta#H)
        p   path to output file
        R   Radius caluclated from average distance to passivation (Angstroms)
        r   radius used for making pores (Angstroms)
        S   The Full scale of the model (filescale*scale)
        %<elementSymbol>%   The percent of the element in model by number
        #<elementSymbol>#   The number of the element in model
    Note: these weill be written as headers to the datafile in the order selected
    Example: tag I%Si%RO
